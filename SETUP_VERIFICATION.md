# Quick Setup Guide - Field Verification Feature

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
Execute the SQL migration to add verification columns to your database:

# Option 2: Using phpMyAdmin
# 1. Open phpMyAdmin
# 2. Select your database
# 3. Go to "SQL" tab

**SQL Commands Added:**
